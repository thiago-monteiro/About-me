# About Me
I am a teenager making various CS Projects. I have put all the ones I'm not at all interested in trying to make money from here on GitHub so other people can either make some use of it or get some understanding on what I've been working on. It's also to back some stuff up in case my PC dies.

## Projects not included here
* Actually Cool Projects
  * PowerEcology GO (An application that lets you take pictures of various objects and see if they're recyclable. Available on Google Play)
  * War of Titans (3D mobile RPG game where you use various magical abilities on each level to beat bosses. Available on Google Play)
  * Pitfall 3D 2022 Remaster RTX/VR edition (A platformer game that uses NVIDIA RTX real-time ray tracing and Oculus Quest Link to provide an extremely immersive VR experience on compatible Oculus headsets. What if Atari Pitfall was made in 2022?)
  * Spartan robotics ball detection (A high-performance ball detection model that runs entirely on Coral TPUs. Also includes depth estimation based on camera intrinsics/extrinsics Made for my high school robotics team.
  * Stock prediction (Surprisingly simple, yet accurate way of extimating stock prices using AI)
  * Game recommendation service for Steam (Just a basic recommender of steam games based on games you've played in the past)
  * Ultra Vantage (A website that lets you view stocks. It's on repl.it instead)
  
* Weird Projects (I made these but probably won't show people them)
  * Slightly weird looking deepfakes (Elon Musk presents the iPhone 13 at the September Apples event. I don't know why I made this, just know that you probably aren't intelligent enough to understand my motive.) (That last sentence is a joke for anyone who couldn't tell.)
  * A couple broken websites I don't really care about (PocketDisco, some Progressive Web App testing, and a broken Tic-Tac-Toe app I made to learn Firebase databases)
