# About Me
I am a teenager making various CS Projects. I have put all the ones I'm not at all interested in trying to make money from and are small enough here on GitHub. I'm also using GitHub to also to back some stuff up in case my PC explodes. The projects in the list below and the ones that are public have been made over a period of many years. The dates for commits are probably nowhere near when they were actually made.

## Projects not published on GitHub
* Somewhat polished / actually good projects
  * PowerEcology GO (An application that lets you take pictures of various objects and see if they're recyclable. Available on Google Play)
  * War of Titans (3D mobile RPG game where you use various magical abilities on each level to beat bosses. Available on Google Play)
  * Pitfall 3D 2022 Remaster RTX/VR edition (A platformer game that uses real-time ray tracing and Oculus Quest Link to provide an immersive VR experience. Based on one of the first ever platformers for the Atari 2600, what if that game was remade in 2022?)
  * Stock prediction (Not perfect, but surprisingly simple, yet accurate way of extimating stock prices using both statistical modeling and NLP)
  * Game recommendation service for Steam (Just a basic recommender of steam games based on games you've played in the past)
  * Ultra Vantage (A website that lets you view stocks. It's on repl.it)
  * 50-minute metaverse (A VR metaverse I glued together in 50 minutes that uses Quest Link, ray tracing, and a photoreal map of our world using Google's API, made using the Unity game engine.)
  * SheldonBot (Uses movie scripts to replicate a chat with them using LLMs. There is even a Flask web server backend and Svelte frontend to run it in a browser)
  * First person shooter based on movement abilities (Coming soon to Steam)
  
* Weird / Broken Projects
  * Deepfakes
  * Some broken websites I don't really care about (PocketDisco, some Progressive Web App testing, and a broken Tic-Tac-Toe app I made to learn realtime databases).
  * A game called "Click the Button" that involves spamming a button for 20 seconds. Made for learning Android development and putting an app on the app store. Later, I made an iOS version to learn iOS but it isn't on the App Store.
  * I tried using some of IBM's free cloud quantum computers. I didn't manage to do anything useful.
